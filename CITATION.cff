title: "Semantic Unit: A Framework for Deterministic AI Testing"
abstract: >-
  Semantic Unit provides a novel framework for deterministic evaluation of 
  large language model outputs through semantic drift detection and 
  distributional alignment analysis. The framework implements zero-shot 
  semantic comparison in latent space, enabling reproducible quality 
  assurance for AI systems. By quantifying semantic entropy and factual 
  fidelity, Semantic Unit addresses the critical challenge of non-deterministic 
  evaluation in production AI applications.
